# Snippet Plugin for Neovim

## About the Project
The plugin makes it possible to easily save text or code snippets and to paste
them at a given place if needed. For this purpose, a simple snippet management
is provided, which offers the possibility to select among the available
snippets using [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
The snippets are persisted in an external file.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Make sure that both [neovim](https://neovim.io/) and the plugin [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim#installation) are installed.
Just follow the installation sections of them.

### Installation

Install the Neovim API for Haskell [nvim-hs](https://github.com/neovimhaskell/nvim-hs) using your favorite nvim plugin manager. (e.g. [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug))

```vimL
Plug 'neovimhaskell/nvim-hs.vim'
```

## Usage
### Setup
1. Clone this Git Repository
2. Create a file that is loaded by neovim on startup and add the following content:
```lua
vim.cmd( [[ 
  call nvimhs#start('PATH/TO/THE/REPO', 'snips', []) 
]])
```
3. Run `stack build` in your repository's folder
4. Test the installation: run `:echo SnipsVersion()`, this should print a message to the status line.

### Creating a snippet
1. Open a file in Neovim and select the code lines you want to save as snippet.
2. Switch to Neovims command mode by typing `:` and type `SnipsCreate` just after `:'<,'>`.
3. In the newly opened buffer, replace words that you want to use as placeholders by a string that is quoted by `<#` / `#>`
    _Note_: if you use the same quoted string multiple times, snips-nvim will use the same text replacements when you use the snippet.
4. Switch to Neovims command mode by typing `:` and type `SnipsSave` just after `:`.
5. Enter a name for the new snippet

The snippet will now be saved and it is possible to retrieve it at any time.

### Finding a snippet
If you created a snippet, you can retrieve it at any time.
1. Open any file in Neovim
2. Switch to Neovims command mode by typing `:` and type `Snips` just after `:`.
3. Telescope opens and you are able to fuzzy find your desired snippet by typing the snippets name
4. Choose a Snippet to insert by hitting Enter
5. Snips-nvim asks you now to add the placeholder replacement texts. (Placeholders with the same names, will get the same values.)

The snippet is now pasted to your previous opened buffer.

_Note:_ snips-nvim stores and retrieves snippets per filetype. Therefore telescope only shows you the snippets matching the filetype of your currently opened buffer. 
You can set the filetype of a file manually using `:set filetype=haskell`

### Debugging
1. export the function in the module definition
2. start cabal using `cabal repl`
3. execute the function (e.g. for a function `hello` in the module `Plugin.FprodTeam` just run `Plugin.FprodTeam.hello`)
Tip: See also: [Debug in nvim-hs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nvim-hs-0.2.4/docs/Neovim-Debug.html#v:debug)

### Recompile the plugin in Neovim
add a keybinding to your nvim config:
  nvim: 
  ```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<F5>",
  function()
    vim.cmd([[ call nvimhs#compileAndRestart('snips') ]])
    print("recompiled")
  end
)
```

## Testing
To run all tests, follow the steps below.

Start cabal in the test folder:
```sh
cabal v2-repl tests
```
Execute the `main` function:
```sh
ghci> main
```
